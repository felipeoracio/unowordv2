# UnoWord AI Writing Coach — Phase 1 Specification

## Current product baseline

The authoritative existing product is the public `felipeoracio/uno-word`
repository. It is a Manifest V3 Chrome extension with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
popup, `background.js` service worker, `content.js` input observer, and
`chrome.storage.local` as its only persistence layer. `shared/wordcount.js`
owns Unicode-aware typed/pasted word counting; `shared/history.js` owns local
history, streaks, CSV, and range aggregation; `shared/prompts.js` owns the
English/Spanish static prompt library. The local Pro toggle is a demo setting,
not server-authenticated billing.

The synchronized upstream baseline had no account/auth system, Supabase,
Stripe, remote document storage, or AI provider. This workspace now adds the
Supabase backend alongside that preserved extension; word counting, sessions,
progress, and basic prompts remain unchanged.

## Phase 1 backend foundation

The mounted Emergent workspace exposes FastAPI routes under `/api`, while all
new AI persistence is defined for Supabase Postgres. The migration at
`supabase/migrations/20260929010000_ai_writing_coach_foundation.sql` creates:

- `ai_profiles` and `ai_onboarding_answers`
- `ai_documents` and `ai_document_chunks`
- `ai_writing_sessions` and `ai_writing_chunks`
- `ai_memories`, `ai_suggestions`, `ai_feedback`, and `ai_usage`
- `ai_entitlements` for server-authoritative paid access

Every table has Row Level Security. Policies scope rows to `auth.uid()`, the
private `ai-documents` Storage bucket scopes object paths to the user's UUID,
and the `match_ai_context` RPC can retrieve only the caller's vector context.
Embedding columns use `vector(1536)` with partial HNSW cosine indexes.

## Authentication and provider behavior

`AI_AUTH_MODE=supabase` is live. `/api/auth/signup`, `/login`, `/refresh`,
`/me`, and `/logout` proxy Supabase Auth and keep browser tokens in secure,
httpOnly cookies. FastAPI verifies this project's legacy HS256 user tokens and
also supports JWKS after a future asymmetric signing-key rotation. Paid access
comes from `ai_entitlements`, never the extension's demo plan.

`AI_PROVIDER=mock` and `AI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini` are configuration defaults.
The mock provider is deterministic and validates the same structured response
contract a future OpenAI-compatible provider must satisfy. No provider key is
stored in or exposed to the extension.

## Key flows

1. The existing extension runs locally and offline exactly as before.
2. A Supabase-authenticated client can upsert a profile and onboarding answers.
3. Authenticated users can create protected document metadata and extracted
   chunks; binary parsers remain a separate future processor.
4. Users explicitly choose whether a completed writing session becomes AI
   memory; keystrokes are never automatically persisted as AI memory.
5. Suggestion requests retrieve only the requesting user's highest-overlap
   memories/chunks, call the configured provider, validate the structured
   result, save a suggestion, and record usage.
6. Feedback is scoped to an owned suggestion and changes its status only.

## Known intentional limits

- **MOCKED:** the AI provider is a deterministic local fallback; no external
  model or embeddings call is enabled in this phase.
- The private Storage bucket and document metadata/chunk schema are live, but
  binary upload/parsers and embeddings generation are not enabled yet.
- Supabase Auth verifies legacy HS256 access tokens with the project JWT secret
  (and supports JWKS for a future asymmetric-key rotation). FastAPI forwards
  the verified user token to PostgREST, so RLS remains authoritative; service-
  role calls are restricted to entitlement lookup and usage writes.

## Extension AI onboarding foundation

The verified GitHub extension source at commit `a4fb0ba` is synchronized into
`/app/extension`. Its existing Pro onboarding is now five steps: language,
word goal, themes, optional AI context, and completion. The optional context
captures a writing goal, audience, current projects, and topics to avoid.

The draft is sanitized by `extension/shared/ai-profile.js` and stored inside
`wc_settings.aiProfileDraft` with `syncStatus: "local_only"`. It is never sent
to the backend automatically. Skipping the step does not erase an existing
draft. `toApiProfile()` prepares the Supabase payload shape used only after the
writer signs in and explicitly confirms the first sync.

## Verified Supabase isolation

Two confirmed test accounts with active Pro entitlements are documented in
`memory/test_credentials.md`. Public-ingress verification proved separate
profiles and memories, blocked cross-user memory deletion and document status
access, generated a suggestion, and recorded user-scoped usage through RLS.

## Extension authentication and profile sync

Extension version `0.5.0` adds an Account section inside the existing Settings
panel. The service worker calls the UnoWord backend with browser-managed,
secure httpOnly cookies; no access or refresh token is stored in
`chrome.storage`. The manifest grants host access only to the UnoWord API host.

Signed-out users retain all local writing features and see a clear sign-in
requirement for AI access. AI settings and the AI onboarding step are hidden
until `/api/auth/me` confirms both authentication and an active server-side
entitlement. The first local-profile sync requires confirmation and merges
non-empty local fields over cloud fields. After consent, future profile edits
auto-sync; writing sessions are still never uploaded automatically.

## Consent-based writing memory

Extension version `0.6.0` adds Save, Don't Save, and Always Save after a session
ends. The content script returns the active editor's text only after explicit
Save consent or a previously confirmed Always Save preference; standard input
events continue sending word-count deltas only. Password inputs are never
captured and writing is limited to 100,000 characters per session.

Every saved item is first encrypted with AES-GCM. A non-extractable device key
lives in IndexedDB; `chrome.storage.local` receives ciphertext, IV, ownership,
and queue state only. The queue holds up to 100 sessions with no expiry.
Pre-login ciphertext remains unclaimed until a signed-in, entitled user
explicitly attaches it. Successful cloud sync keeps the encrypted device copy
until the user chooses Delete Synced Device Copies in AI Settings.

The backend chunks saved writing into bounded overlapping retrieval records.
`existing_session_ref` has a user-scoped unique index so offline retries cannot
create duplicate cloud sessions.
